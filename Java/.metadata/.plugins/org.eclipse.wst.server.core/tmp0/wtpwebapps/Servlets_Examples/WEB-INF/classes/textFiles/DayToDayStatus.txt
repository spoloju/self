Standalone Applications or Desktop Applications 
    --- Applications which run with main method
    
Web Applications
   -- Applications which can be deployed in server and can be executed from browser
   
   To build Web Applications we need Servlet type of java programs
   
   
   What is meant by Servlet ?
     -- Servlet is a special type of java program which can be executed from browser
       in order to receive the data from browser to servlet in the form of request and 
       to deliver the data to browser from servlet in the form of response
       
   Why do we use Servlets ?
      ---- to build web applications
      
   How to create Servlet type of java program ?
      -- Create a normal java class and extends HttpServlet java program
      
   Note : All the predefined classes and interfaces related to servlets concept are present under javax.servlet package
   
   this package is present in a file called as servlet-api.jar which is part of tomcat servet lib folder
   
   
Unlike desktop applications for servlets in order to execute we have certain predefined methods

  doGet  -- method arguments are HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse
  
  HttpServletRequest is capable to receive the data from browser to servlet in the form of request
  HttpServletResponse is capable to deliver the data from servlet to browser in the form of response
  
  
  STEP 1 -- Create a  normal java program and make the program to behave as servlet program through extends HttpServlet
  
  STEP 2 -- Define the statements in the predefined methods of Servlet java programs
  
  STEP 3 -- Configure Servlet type of programs in the web.xml file  ******
  			Note : Add tomcat server location to eclipse servers tab
  
  STEP 4 -- Deploying in server and starting server
  
  STEP 5  -- Configuring the URL to give a request from browser to servlet program
  				localhost:8080/appName/url
  				
  				localhost   -- represents our machine in which

  How to deliver response from servlet program to browser
       resp.setContentType("text/html");   -- to give information regarding what type of data are we delivering as response
       resp.getWriter()  -- will return an object of type as PrintWriter
       
       Through calling .println method of PrintWriter java class we can write some data on to the browser as response
       
  
  How to give request from html file of browser 
      using form html tag we submit a request from browser to servlet java program
      
      <form action="" method="">
      
      </form>
      
      using action attribute we give the information regarding to which servlet java program we give the request 
      using method attribute we give the information regarding to which method of servlet java program we give the request
      
      
  
  How to read the data from request in servlet java program
      -- using name attribute we identify every html element in a unique way from the request
      
       req.getParameter("usrName")  --- this stmt reads the data from a html element which is defined with name attribute value of usrName 
       
  
  Difference between doGet and doPost methods
    doGet
       -- will be used when the requirement is to get the data from servlet to browser
       -- when we send data to doGet method, data gets exposed in browser url
       -- we can send data to doGet method with a size limit of 256KB
       
    doPost
      -- will be used to submit the data of more html elements from browser to servlet
      -- when we send data to doPost method, nothing gets exposed in browser url
      -- we can send data to doPost method without any size limit
  
  html   -- servlet   -- jdbc  --- db    (complete flow from browser to database of an application)
  
  Servlet Life Cycle
      -- Different methods executed from birth of Servlet object till destruction of Servlet object are called as Servlet Life Cycle Methods
      
      STEP 1 --  default constructor -- object creation
      STEP 2 --   init method
      STEP 3 --  doGet/doPost 
      STEP 4 --  destroy
      
      Out of Which, STEP 1,2,4 will be executed only once irrespective of no of requests we may give from browser to Servlet java program
      STEP 3 will be executed every time we give a request to any of the method from Servlet java program
      
      By Default, Object creation for Servlet java program will be done when we give the request to Servlet java program for the first time
  
  load-on-startup tag
     -- If we wish to get the servlet object created during server startup time itself then we configure loadonstartup tag in web.xml file 
     		during servlet configuration process

  Servlet Chaining   -- Chaining the request from 1 servlet to other servlet java class is called as Servlet Chaining
      .forward   -- then only the response from final servlet program participating in servlet chaining will be delivered to browser
      .include   -- collective responses from all servlet programs participating in servlet chaining will be delivered to browser
      .sendRedirect
      
      
      response in  sendRedirect
          we get response only from final servlet program participating in servlet chaining
          data passed during initial request is not available in the servlet program participating in servlet chaining
      
  
  Difference between .forward and .include
    Response from only final servlet program will be delivered to browser when we do servlet chaining using .forward mode of servlet chaining 
    where as 
    Collective responses from all the servlet programs will be delivered to browser in case of .include mode of servlet chaining
   
      
  Difference between .forward and .sendRedirect
    Response only from final servlet program will be delivered to browser even when we do servlet chaining with respect to .forward or .sendRedirect
     BUT
     It is the same request which will be chained across all the servlets in case of .forward mode of servlet chaining
     where as 
     It will be new request which will be chained to other servlet program to which we are doing servlet chaining
  
  
  Servlet Response Status Codes  --- indicates how request is getting executed at server
     200   --- which indicates request is successfully executed
     302   --- which indicates incomplete response (which is going to invoke another new request from browser which happens in case of .sendRedirect)
     400   --- which indicates bad request  (when data given in request object is not matching to the data expected by web service)
     404   --- when we are not able to identify resource or servlet with given url pattern
     500   --- When we get any exception at server side when we give a request then we get 500 response status code
    
    
    Filters
    
    Filter  -- Filter is a special type of servlet program which takes care of validating the request 
    					and in positive scenario we can chain the request from Filter to intended servlet program 
    					    in negative scenario we can redirect the request from filter to browser

    How to create a filter type of program ?
    create a normal java class and implements Filter interface
    
        init   -- this method gets executed immediately once server creates an object for this filter program
        doFilter  -- this method gets executed every time when the request comes to filter program
        destroy   -- this method gets executed when we stop the server
    
    
    How to configure filter type of program in web.xml ?		     
		  <filter>
		      <filter-name>authFilter</filter-name>
		  	  <filter-class>filters.AuthorizedFilter</filter-class>
		  </filter>
		  <filter-mapping>
		      <filter-name>authFilter</filter-name>
		  	  <url-pattern>/regSrv</url-pattern>
		  </filter-mapping>
    
    How to map the request from filter to servlet in web.xml ?
      when we give request with url pattern as /regSrv      
      First request reaches to filter program and from there we can either map to intended servlet program which gets identified with same url pattern
       or we can redirect the request
    
    How to chain the request from filter to intended servlet program ?
      chain.doFilter(req,resp)
    
    How to redirect the request from filter back to browser ?
       -- using an object of type as RequestDispatcher 
    
    
  
  Http Follows Stateless protocol
    -- when ever we give a request then server will create a new set of request and response obejcts
    
     -- By default http maintains data in the request object only till the time its respective response gets delivered to browser
     
     Once response gets delivered to browser then immediately respective request and response objects will be destroyed from server

  HttpSession 
  
    Maintaining data in an application for a Period of time from login to logout is called as a Session
    
    req.getSession(true)   --- server will create a new HttpSession object
    
    setAttribute(key, value)   -- to set the data into session object
    
    getAttribute(key)     -- to get the data from session object
    
    req.getSession()    --- will get access to already created HttpSession object
  
    sessionObj.invalidate()  -- session object will be destroyed in server
