1. CA (or where the Product is being supplied outside of North America the CA
subsidiary identified after Section 15 below for the country in which the
Product is being supplied, and in such instance CA shall mean the CA
subsidiary identified) provides Licensee with one copy of the Product, for

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as well as the terms of (a) any CA
Order Form or Registration Form which has been signed by Licensee and CA; or
(b) a License Program Certificate which is provided by CA to Licensee, as

2. If the Product is an alpha or beta version of the program, hereinafter
referred to as the &quot;beta program&quot; or &quot;beta version&quot; and not generally
available to date, CA does not guarantee that the generally available release
will be identical to the beta program or that the generally available release
will not require reinstallation. Licensee agrees that if it registers for
support or if otherwise required by CA, Licensee shall provide CA with
specific information concerning Licensee&apos;s experiences with the operation of
the Product. Licensee agrees and acknowledges that the beta version of the
Product (a) is to be used only for testing purposes and not to perform any
production activities unless CA shall have otherwise approved in writing and
(b) has not been tested or debugged and is experimental and that the
documentation may be in draft form and will, in many cases, be incomplete.
Licensee agrees that CA makes no representations regarding the completeness,
accuracy or Licensee&apos;s use or operation of the beta version of the Product.
BETA PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
If Licensee is also a Tester of the beta version of the Product (as &quot;Tester&quot;
is defined by the Beta Testing Agreement that was agreed to by Licensee
during the registration process before obtaining the beta version of the
Product), Licensee agrees that the terms of this Agreement are in addition
to, and do not supersede, the terms of the Beta Testing Agreement.

3. If the Product is being licensed on a trial or evaluation basis, Licensee
agrees to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes, in accordance with
the usage restrictions set forth in Section 1, for a thirty-day evaluation
period unless a different period is otherwise noted (the &quot;Trial Period&quot;). At

conditions of this paragraph apply solely for the use of the SDK. The SDK may

integration of third party software or hardware with the Product, or to
develop software that functions with the Product, such as an agent.
Licensee&apos;s use of the SDK is restricted solely to enhance Licensee&apos;s internal
use of the Product. No distribution rights of any kind are granted to
Licensee regarding the Product. In addition to the limitations on use set
forth in Section 8, below, Licensee may not reproduce, disclose, market, or
distribute the SDK or the documentation or any applications containing any
executable versions of the SDK to third parties, on the internet, or use such
executables in excess of the applicable Authorized Use Limitation. If there
is a conflict between the terms of this section and the terms of any other
section in this Agreement, the terms of this section will prevail solely with
respect to the use of the SDK. 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE SDK IS PROVIDED AND LICENSED
&quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

duties or taxes must be supported by proper documentary evidence delivered to
CA. Any invoice which is unpaid by Licensee when due shall be subject to an
interest charge equal to the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest

7. Licensee may use the Product as provided herein solely to process its own

8. The Product, including any source or object code that may be provided to
Licensee hereunder, as well as documentation, appearance, structure and

written consent of CA. Licensee shall not release the results of any
benchmark testing of the Product to any third party without the prior written
consent of CA. Licensee will not transfer, assign, rent, lease, use, copy or

testing shall be limited to one week in any three month period. The Product
may be used only within the boundaries of the country where the Product was
purchased (except as otherwise provided on the Order Form) unless CA consents
otherwise in writing. If this license terminates for any reason, Licensee
shall certify to CA in writing that all copies and partial copies of the
Product have been deleted from all computers and storage devices and are
returned to CA or destroyed and are no longer in use. Licensee shall comply
with all relevant import and export regulations, including those adopted by

Product and any accompanying documentation have been developed entirely at
private expense. They are delivered and licensed as &quot;commercial item&quot;
&quot;computer software&quot; as defined in FAR 2.101. In the event Licensee is a U.S.
Federal Government agency, the licensing terms of CA&apos;s then current GSA FSS
contract shall govern use of the Computer Program(s), in lieu of the terms
contained in the license delivered with the Program(s). For such purposes,
the term &quot;Product&quot; and &quot;Computer Program&quot; shall have the same meaning
hereunder. The Computer Program(s) was developed at private expense, is
commercial, and is published and copyrighted. Third parties purchasing on
behalf of a Federal Government agency shall only transfer the Computer
Program(s) to the Government with &quot;Restricted Rights&quot; as that term is defined
in FAR 52.227-19(c)(2) or DFAR 252.227-7015, and in accordance with CA&apos;s then
current GSA FSS contract. All Software is provided FOB shipping point or

electronic delivery. CA is the manufacturer of the Product.
This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law
provisions. 

9. CA warrants that it can enter into this Agreement and that it will
indemnify, hold Licensee harmless, and defend or, at its option, settle any
claim that CA is not so authorized or that Licensee&apos;s use of the Product as
authorized hereby infringes any patent, copyright or other intellectual
property right of any third party. CA also warrants that the Product will
operate in accordance with its published specifications, provided that CA&apos;s
only responsibility will be to use reasonable efforts, consistent with
industry standards, to cure any defect. The foregoing warranty respecting the
operation of the Product will be in effect only during any period for which
Licensee shall have paid the applicable license fee and annual maintenance
fee, or, with respect to Products licensed without an Order Form, during a
period of ninety (90) days from Licensee&apos;s acquisition of license for the
Product. If, within a reasonable time after receiving Licensee&apos;s written
notice of breach of either of the above warranties, CA is unable to cause the
Product to operate (a) without infringing a third party&apos;s intellectual
property rights, or (b) in accordance with CA&apos;s written specifications, then
either party may terminate this Agreement on written notice to the other
party and CA or the authorized reseller will refund the relevant license fees
paid for such non-compliant Product only when Licensee returns the Product to
CA or its authorized reseller from whom it obtained the Product, with the
purchase receipt within the warranty period noted above. The warranties set
forth in this Section do not apply to beta versions of the Product, Product
licensed on a trial or evaluation basis or to Software Development Kits.

LICENSE FEE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE PRODUCT BY LICENSEE. NO THIRD PARTY,
INCLUDING AGENTS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR AUTHORIZED CA RESELLERS IS AUTHORIZED TO
MODIFY ANY OF THE ABOVE WARRANTIES OR MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES ON
BEHALF OF CA. CA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCT WILL MEET LICENSEE&apos;S
REQUIREMENTS OR THAT USE OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

subsidiaries. CA may assign this Agreement to any third party that succeeds
